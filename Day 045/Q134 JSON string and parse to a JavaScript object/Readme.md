Take a JSON string and parse it into a JavaScript object.

**Note**
The code demonstrates JSON.parse(), which converts a JSON string jsonString (representing a person with name, age, and city) back into a JavaScript object person. When person is logged, it outputs the original object structure, showing how JSON.parse() is used to deserialize JSON data into JavaScript objects, essential for handling data from APIs or stored in JSON format.
