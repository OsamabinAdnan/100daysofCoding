Write a function that checks if a Map contains a key for `Canada` and logs the capital if it exists.

1) The `has` method of the Map object is used to check if the map contains the key "Canada"
2) `countries.has("Canada")` returns true if the key exists in the map, and false otherwise.
3) If "Canada" is found in the map, `countries.get("Canada")` retrieves the value associated with that key, which is "Ottawa"
