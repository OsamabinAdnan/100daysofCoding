1) Generating a Random Hexadecimal Color
    a) Generating the Random Number
    * `Math.random()`: This method returns a pseudo-random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)
    * `Math.random() * 0xffffff`: Multiplies the random number by 0xffffff. 0xffffff is the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal color #ffffff (which is 16777215 in decimal). This scales the random number to a range between 0 and 0xffffff.
    * `Math.floor(...)`: The Math.floor function rounds down the floating-point number to the nearest whole number. This ensures that we get an integer between 0 and 0xffffff.

    b) Converting to Hexadecimal
    * `.toString(16)`: Converts the integer to a hexadecimal string. The 16 specifies that the number should be converted to base-16 (hexadecimal).

    c) Formatting the Hexadecimal String
    * `.padStart(6, 0)`: Ensures that the resulting hexadecimal string is at least 6 characters long. If the hexadecimal string is shorter than 6 characters, it pads the string on the left with 0 to make it exactly 6 characters long. This is important because a valid hexadecimal color code must
