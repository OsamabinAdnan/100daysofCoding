1) Creating the Current Date Object:
    `const date = new Date();`
    
    * `new Date()`: This constructs a new Date object with the current date and time according to the system's clock.
    * date: This variable holds the current date and time. For example, if today is August 25, 2024, date will represent that exact moment, including the time of day.

2) Creating the New Year Date Object:
    `const newYear = new Date(date.getFullYear() + 1, 0, 1);`
    * `date.getFullYear()`: This method returns the year of the date object. For example, if date represents 2024, date getFullYear() will return 2024.
    * `date.getFullYear()` + 1: Adds 1 to the current year to get the next year. So if the current year is 2024, this expression evaluates to 2025.
    * new Date`(date.getFullYear() + 1, 0, 1)`: Creates a new Date object for January 1st of the next year. In this case, it will create a Date object for January 1, 2025.
        * The Date constructor accepts parameters in the order: year, month (0-indexed, so 0 for January), and day of the month. This results in the newYear variable holding the start of the next calendar year, with time set to 00:00:00 by default.

3) Calculating the Difference in Time:
    `const difference = newYear.getTime() - date.getTime();`
    * `newYear.getTime()`: Returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970) for the newYear date object. This represents the exact moment of January 1, 2025, in milliseconds.
    * `date.getTime()`: Similarly, returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch for the date object (e.g., August 25, 2024).
    * `newYear.getTime()` - `date.getTime()`: Calculates the difference between the two time values in milliseconds. This represents the time span between now and the start of the next year.

4) Converting the Difference to Days:
    `const days = Math.ceil(difference / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));`
    * 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24: This is the number of milliseconds in one day.
        * 1000 milliseconds in a second,
        * 60 seconds in a minute,
        * 60 minutes in an hour,
        * 24 hours in a day.
    * difference / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24): Converts the time difference from milliseconds to days. This result might be a fractional value (e.g., 1.5 days).
    * Math.ceil(...): Rounds up the result to the next whole number. This ensures that any fraction of a day counts as a full day. For example, if the difference is 1.1 days, Math.ceil will round it to 2 days.
