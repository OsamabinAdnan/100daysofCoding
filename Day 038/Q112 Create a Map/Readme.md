Q.112) Create a Map that stores the names of countries as keys and their capitals as values. Add three countries to the Map.

*Note*
The code creates a Map named countries to store country-capital pairs. Three key-value pairs are added to the map using the set method: "USA" with capital "Washington, D.C.", "France" with capital "Paris", and "Japan" with capital "Tokyo". Finally, the code logs the entire map using console.log(). This approach is useful for organizing and accessing data in pairs, such as countries and their capitals.

1) `Map` object to create and manage a collection of key-value pairs.
2) `Map` <string, string> specifies that this map will use string for both keys and values.
3) The `set` method is used to add entries to the Map.
4) Each call to `set` adds a new entry where the first argument is the key and the second argument is the value.
