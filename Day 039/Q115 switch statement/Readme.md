Use a switch statement to log the days of the week based on a number (1-7).

1) The `switch` statement evaluates the value of the days parameter and compares it to the various `case` labels.

2) The `break` statement prevents the execution from falling through to the next case

3) The `default` case handles any values of days that do not match any of the specified cases (i.e., values other than 1 through 7).
